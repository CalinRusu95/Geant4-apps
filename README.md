APP3 - GPS particle source followed by scattering foil (Au/Al), colimator module and tally binarized volume for dose and LET measurement.
APP5 - GPS particle source followed by vaccum tube, colimator module and tally binarized volume for dose and LET measurement.

TD3MV - This is the updated version of the APP3. This work in progress simulation emulates the experimental setup from the 3MV Tandetron particle accelerator. This application uses a Monte-Carlo model for simulating a disc-shaped particle source via the PrimaryGeneratorAction mandatory class. The RunInput user defined class provides an input parameters set.
